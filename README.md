# Classifying-Fashion-MNIST

Dataset : Fashion MNIST
Fashion MNIST is a popular image classification dataset used in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It contains 70,000 grayscale images of 28x28 pixels each, representing 10 different types of clothing items such as t-shirts, trousers, and dresses. The dataset is often used as a benchmark for testing and comparing different machine learning algorithms for image classification tasks. It is widely used by researchers, students, and practitioners to explore new techniques and models for image recognition. The Fashion MNIST dataset is considered to be an upgrade to the classic MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digits. The dataset is freely available for download and use from the official website.
